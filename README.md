# Python challenges

This repo was created to satisfy the challenges
of the platzi Datacadmy course.

The code should:
- [x] Compute a triangle area.
- [x] Compute a triangle type.
- [ ] Rock paper scissors.
- [ ] Unit converter.
- [ ] Volumes calculator.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x

## Notes
- The main requirement was to compute
area using the `a = (b * h) / 2`, nevertheless
to compute the triangle we should ask for 
additional data, in order to only ask for the 3 
triangle side lengths we use the Heron's formula
  to compute thr triangle height, please see [heron' formula](https://www.mathsisfun.com/geometry/herons-formula.html).
